The pennine way is not one of your average walks. It is a thru-hike that me and a friend will be doing
with wild camping thrown in.  We will have everything we need for the journey in our bags.  We will be using no guides, pick up points or other glamping methods.

This blog will hopefully guide you through peperation, tips, plans and some good sound advise about kit and keeping
things manageable.

> The Pennine Way is a National Trail in England, with a small section in Scotland. The trail stretches for 268 miles from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park and ends at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border
